## About
Nae is Not An Engine, is a portable multimedia layer with an easy API designed to make your own multimedia apps on top of it.

## Goals
- HTML5 must be a first class citizen using Webassembly.
- Support as many platforms as posible.
- Provide an abstraction layer to add new platforms easily (even privates like consoles). 
- Make easy to deploy on these platforms with a CLI.
- Provide an API that run on each platform without changes.

## Examples
```rust 
fn main() {}
```
